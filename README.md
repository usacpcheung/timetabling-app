# Timetabling Optimization App

A local-first, browser-based school timetabling application built with **Python (Flask)**, **SQLite**, and a simple HTML frontend. It allows users to define scheduling items (e.g., classes, teachers, rooms), specify rules and constraints, and automatically generate a valid timetable using constraint-solving algorithms.
